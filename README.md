IMAD Assignment 2 - Tamagotchi Application
----------------------------------------
Steps to follow:

Step 1 - Download my Tamagotchi App
Step 2 - Once downloaded, Open up the application and meet your new pet, Reggie!
Step 3 - Follow the bottom button that says "Get Started!" to start playing with your pet, Reggie
Step 4 - Explore the game by taking a look at the different action buttons that you can use, choose a button and click on it
Step 5 - Click on the button as many times as you want or until the bar is full, (this means your pet is fully satisfied!)
Step 6 - Play around with Reggie for as long as you like, but don't forget, his satisfaction (the progress bar) will deplete so keep playing with the buttons by clicking them
If you are done playing the Reggie:
6 - Close the application and see you next time!

----------------------------------------
The application is essentially a game that was previously known as a Tamagotchi App. This means you get your very own online pet where you can feed, clean and play with it for as long as you'd like! There are multiple buttons that allow you to interact with your pet, in this case, with Reggie. Have fun feeding, cleaning and playing with Reggie in order to increase his progress bar, the fuller the bar, the more satisfied Reggie is. Take care of Reggie and enjoy your time together!
